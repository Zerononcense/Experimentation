#### **_Inability to Cut Losses_**

This is probably the most common one that afflicts traders nowadays. It’s even happened to me a few times.

_Scenario:_

You’ve plotted a chart and you’re 1000% confident that you’re going to make profit. Something unexpected happens and you lose a ton of money. You think to yourself, “I don’t want to lose money!” Or you listen to all of the things that people say regarding ‘weak hands’ or ‘hodl’ and you think to yourself that you’re simply making a mistake if you decide to sell.

What if you sell and it goes back up immediately? How would you feel? So, you hold on. -5%. -10%. -20%. Even -30%.

At a certain point in a trade, if you’re getting your ask kicked, you simply have to pull out.

#### **_Staying in a Trade for Too Long_**

Sometimes traders make an amazing trade and they end up making exorbitant profits. Let’s say, for instance, that you bought Bitcoin in the beginning of 2017 when the price was approximately $900. Now, imagine you successfully held on to Bitcoin until it reached the price of $20,000.

That’s an awesome gain! Right? So, when it finally began to draw down from the $20,000 marker, the common consensus would be to hold on to the Bitcoin. However, there are times when individuals irrationally hold on to the price of Bitcoin. While they may still be in profit since the beginning of 2017 up to this point, this trader has suffered many unnecessary losses.

#### **Averaging Down**

I’m not 100% certain that this should be on the list, because it is a useful technique if you see that there is a true reversal that will come soon. However, there are instances where one may average down to mitigate losses and end up simply losing even more money than what they were going to lose in the first place.

Take for example the common foolish mentality that is prevalent in the Bitcoin community of buying things down.

#### **Failure to Diversify**

There are a lot of traders that put **_all_** of their money in one cryptocurrency under the idea that it’s bound to go up. Sometimes this decision is made to recoup losses that the trader may have suffered earlier. However, it is this emotional trading decision that ultimately will undermine the trader and result in his/her forfeiture of a ridiculous amount of money if the stock goes down.

Sometimes, it goes up and the trader is wildly successful. However, this type of risky, decision making often results in absurd levels of loss.

#### **Chasing the Action; Buying Too Late**

This is one of the things that kill traders most often. Whenever they attempt to ‘chase the action’, they end up losing on unimaginable levels. Typically, in the cryptocurrency world, this occurs when traders attempt to ‘chase after green candles’.

What this literally means is that traders will often see a price that has appreciated strongly in price and will assume that they can also catch those gains (FOMO).

#### **Overtrading**

This one speaks for itself. Sometimes there are so many different options in the market, that one becomes tempted to try to explore every option that becomes available at their fingertips.

This typically results in loss in most instances. Unfortunately, there are many traders that do not seem to understand this important lesson and, as a result, they end up losing much more money trading than they originally had anticipated.

This also has the unfortunate consequence of a trader exiting a cryptocurrency prematurely, even if they’ve already gained profits.

#### **Lack of Patience**

This is definitely, by far, one of the things that kills traders more than anything else. A lack of patience usually precipitates and facilitates the type of reckless trading that will end up with a trader becoming ‘rek’t’ as they say (I sound old but I’m not — weird!).

Thus, the most important thing to do in this instance is to ensure that one is as patient and diligent as possible when deciding entry and exit positions in order to avoid the ills of overtrading, and overdiversification.
